## HSMWmobil - An app by students, for students ❤️
HSMWmobil is used by a wide range of students at University of Applied Sciences Mittweida. 
The app has been developed for over 10 years, has seen multiple major upgrades and has only seen its biggest technical leap in 2022 when taken over to Flutter. 
HSMWmobil now shares one codebase for both Android and iOS and has many cool features yet to be implemented.

### Interested in contributing? 🧪
We are always happy to see people interested in making the app even better.

Although the application and its repositories are not public (yet), you can send an informal email to app@hs-mittweida.de. Please indicate why you would like to access the projects in your mail.
For now, only students and associates of University of Applied Sciences Mittweida are considered for getting access to the project.
